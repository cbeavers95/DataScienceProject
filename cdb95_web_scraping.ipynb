Showing gratitude is a great way to feel happier! But it also has the nice side-effect of reassuring us that you're not passing off someone else's work as your own. Crossover with other courses is permitted and encouraged, but it must be clearly stated, and it must be obvious what parts were and were not done for 2950. Copying without attribution robs you of the chance to learn, and wastes our time investigating."
