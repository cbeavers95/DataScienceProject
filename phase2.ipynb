    "\n",
    "2 - In the data sata regarding gas prices, the attributes are each week in a month (week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4). The observations are gas prices in US dollars per each week in each month between the years 1993 and 2022.\n",

    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - The U.S. Department of transportation conducted a census and appointed researchers to sort and analyze the data types. The sorting caused the data to come to be in the form I am using: fatalities quanitfied by thousands and crash type. \n",
